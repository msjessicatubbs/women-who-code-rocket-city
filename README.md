"Satellite Earth!" 

Our Fun Rock 

Hi! We're Women Who Code- Rocket City! We're Abbey Tipton, Jess Friend, Diamond Atticus, Lorna Bogan, Jessica Tubbs, and Shannon McDade. 


This game will provide elementary school children the opportunity to learn interesting facts about our Earth while also giving them a chance to gain a new perspective by viewing it from space! 


The game works by allowing the player to solve puzzles and quizzes to earn rocket ships to advance to higher levels. 


We used HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, and Python to integrate sounds, puzzle configurations, and webpage design. This allows for ease of access in the classroom and at home. 


This virtual experience has the opportunity to change children's perspectives. It will inspire young minds to look to science to build their understanding of the world around them. Changing one child's mind will change the world!
